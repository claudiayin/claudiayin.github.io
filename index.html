 <p> What is a Repository?</p>
 <p>A repository is a project containing files and folders. A repository tracks versions of files and folders.</p>
 <br>
 <p>What is a Branch?</p>
 <p>A branch is a parallel version of your repository. By default, your repository has one branch named <i>main</i>
 and it is considered to be the definitive branch. Creating additional branched allows you to copy the <i>main</i> branch of your repository and safely make changes without
disrupting the main project. Many people use branches to work on specific features without affectig any other parts of the project</p>
<br>
<p>Branches allow you to separate your work from the <i>main</i> branch.In other words, everyone's work is safe while you contribute.</p>
